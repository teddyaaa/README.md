# Project Documentation

## 1. Summary of the project
This project analyzes [topic, e.g., retail sales performance] using [tool(s), e.g., Excel / Power BI / Python] to answer [main business question].  
The final deliverable is a [dashboard/report/model] that helps [who benefits and how].

## 2. Dataset source
- Dataset name: [e.g., Superstore Sales, HR Attrition]
- Source: [Kaggle / public government site / internal system / self-generated]
- Size & structure: [e.g., 10,000 rows, 20 columns, data from 2019–2023]
- Notes: [major cleaning issues: missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats]

## 3. Tools used
- Main tools: [Excel / Power Query / Power Pivot / Power BI / SQL / Python / R]
- Key features/libraries: [PivotTables, charts, DAX, pandas, ggplot2, etc.]

## 4. Steps you took
1. **Data import & cleaning** – Imported the raw [file type: CSV/Excel] into [tool], handled missing values by [method], removed duplicates, and standardized [dates, text, categories].
2. **Exploratory analysis** – Created summary statistics and basic visuals to understand [distributions, trends, outliers].
3. **Transformations & feature creation** – Built [calculated columns/measures] such as [profit margin, tenure groups, customer segments].
4. **Visualization / model building** – Designed [charts/dashboards/models] focusing on [KPIs or questions].
5. **Validation & iteration** – Checked results with [cross-checks, filters, comparisons] and refined visuals based on clarity and stakeholder feedback (if any).

## 5. Findings / results
- [Metric] increased/decreased by [X%] between [time periods], mainly driven by [segment/region/product].
- Top [n] categories account for [X%] of [sales, churn, etc.].
- Identified [pattern or anomaly], suggesting [possible explanation or action].
- [Any other concise, number-backed result].

## 6. Future questions / next steps
- Add more data on [e.g., marketing spend, demographics] to understand [cause] better.
- Automate the data refresh using [Power Query, Python script, scheduled flow].
- Extend the analysis to [forecasting, clustering, what-if analysis].
